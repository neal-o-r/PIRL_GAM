# PIRL GAM

Logistic Regression Generalised Additive Model, implemented using the Penalised Iterative Re-weighted Least Squares algorithm from Eilers & Marx 1996, with the smoothing parameter fit by Generalised Cross Validation. Should scale fairly well to large number of observations/modest numbers of features.
